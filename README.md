# PDF_search
A script that allows you to search a PDF not only for specific words but also for clusters of words.

This is a WIP project I am using to learn coding with Python. I am aware that there are already similar (and probably much better) tools like this out there.

The end goal is to have a command line tool that will allow users to specify a single word or a text file containing many words and then search a pdf for paragraphs that contain a specified number of those words.

Feel free to provide feedback and ideas for this project.
